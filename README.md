# Short introduction to Graph Theory

## Aim

This presentation is meant to give high school students a basic overview on graph theory, and hopefully stimulate some interest.

## Disclaimer

The Implementations presented are written to be as clear and easy to understand as possible. Don't assume they are optimal.

## Contents

It includes a presentation written in LaTeX and two animations built using [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) python library.

## Credits

Even though the code was entirely written by me, most slides were inspired by a work of Professor Alberto Montresor - University of Trento ([link](http://disi.unitn.it/~montreso/python/B04-grafi.pdf)).
