# Short introduction to Graph Theory

## Aim

This presentation is meant to give high school students a basic overview on graph theory, and hopefully stimulate some interest.

## Credits

Even though the code was entirely written by me, most slides were inspired by a work of Professor Alberto Montresor - University of Trento ([link](http://disi.unitn.it/~montreso/python/B04-grafi.pdf)).

## Status

Still work in progress.
